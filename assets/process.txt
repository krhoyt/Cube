- Canny Edge Detection

self.image = cv2.imread(filename)
gray = cv2.cvtColor(self.image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (3, 3), 0)
canny = cv2.Canny(blurred, 20, 40)

- Dilate thicker lines

kernel = np.ones((3,3), np.uint8)
dilated = cv2.dilate(canny, kernel, iterations=2)

- Contours of joining points

(contours, hierarchy) = cv2.findContours(dilated.copy(), cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

- Contour approximations (approxPolyDP)

- Square contour approximations
-- There must be four corners
-- All four lines must be roughly the same length
-- All four corners must be roughly 90 degrees

- Remove non-squares

- Cube dimensions and boundries
-- Figure out:
--- We are dealing with a 4x4x4 cube
--- We can find the boundries of the cube
-- Throw away contours outside boundaries

- Non-square contours
